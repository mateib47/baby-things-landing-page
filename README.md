This is the landing page for my entrepreneurship project. We are focusing on developing the MVP for our business idea.

Babies constantly grow at a miraculous rate. You have just bought a new outfit only to realize that it's already too small. Going out to carefully pick out fun outfits can be a time consuming activity, something that is fun for some people, but a burden to others. This business idea solves all the hassle, and creates a fun experience for new parents. We offer a subscription service that, based on your preferences, regularly delivers a carefully curated packet with all kinds of baby essentials (could be clothing, but could also be blankets etc.). Parents can fill in a quiz that gives us insight into the preferences of the parents and the needs of the baby. We offer different levels that suit the needs of all families. Items that the baby has grown out of, or are not needed anymore can be returned to us to be donated to charity or recycled, creating a more sustainable environment for the newborn babies to grow up in at the same time.
